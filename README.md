# Customer_Purchase_Check
There are the solution of multiple asked questions and self made question too, I considered it as a Customer Purchase and Expenditure Prediction Project.This project is all about first identifying the missing values in dataset and then handle it carefully using pandas library. 
Afterward, using ML models are doing the work very precisely,by making my dataset more beautifully managed and accurate.
